|**Filter**|**Result**|
|---|---|
|host|`host` will filter visible traffic to show anything involving the designated host. Bi-directional|
|src / dest|`src` and `dest` are modifiers. We can use them to designate a source or destination host or port.|
|net|`net` will show us any traffic sourcing from or destined to the network designated. It uses / notation.|
|proto|will filter for a specific protocol type. (ether, TCP, UDP, and ICMP as examples)|
|port|`port` is bi-directional. It will show any traffic with the specified port as the source or destination.|
|portrange|`portrange` allows us to specify a range of ports. (0-1024)|
|less / greater "< >"|`less` and `greater` can be used to look for a packet or protocol option of a specific size.|
|and / &&|`and` `&&` can be used to concatenate two different filters together. for example, src host AND port.|
|or|`or` allows for a match on either of two conditions. It does not have to meet both. It can be tricky.|
|not|`not` is a modifier saying anything but x. For example, not UDP.|
